The dataset taken was form sklearn datasets of diabites.
The model is trained using last 40 values than the first 40 values are used to test the model designed.

Libraries used :

sklearn

numpy

matplotlib

A graph plot was shown to take a view of diabetes_X_test values vs Diabetes_Y_predicted values showing the MSE.
